This file should save bug information to an xml file. It will receive POST requests from forms on /bugs/new.jsp and /bugs/edit.jsp

Check for an ID in the POST request and load the existing bug to edit if present or create a new bug if not present.

This file will not render any HTML, it will only redirect to existing pages.
